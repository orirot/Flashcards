# Flashcards
The app allows users to study collections of flashcards. You can create your own decks and add cards.
You can test yourself and have a quiz for each deck.

The Project isn't connected to any server, it has an initial set of data and you can add some of your own.
the data is kept on the phone's storage, currently there's no functionality of deleting data so it is just added.

Have fun.
